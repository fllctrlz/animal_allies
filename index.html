			We are a co-ed FLL robotics team from Bayview Glen School in Toronto, Ontario, Canada <br>
			consisting of seven energetic students from grade 5 to grade 9.  Our team members <br> collaborate well together,
			both inside and outside FLL, in all that we do. We love sharing <br> our passion and knowledge about the
			research project and the robot with other teams and with the <br> general public. This is all made possible by
			our dedicated mentors, coaches and sponsors.
