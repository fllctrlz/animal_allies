	<h2>Meeting with Team Mustangs 28624</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On Sunday, October 9, 2016, Ctrl-Z assisted Team Mustangs 28624, a rookie team. We invited 
	Mustangs to our school and we shared insight on how they could improve their robot and learn 
	new concepts in order to achieve more and take more away from their experience in FLL. 
	It was great to meet and help a fellow team who is as interested in FLL as we are. 
	Best of luck to the team.

<h2>Meeting with Team <i>Tribe Called Tech</i> At Bayview Glen School</h2>
<br>
<p>On Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Ctrl-Z welcomed Team <i>Tribe Called Tech</i> of the First Nations School of Toronto
 to our school for an afternoon of learning and collaboration. Members of Ctrl-Z divided into two groups to teach the 
 First Nations students robot design and programming. We covered the characteristics of a robust base robot and modular attachments.
 For programming we taught calibration, line following, and basic robot navigation. We enjoyed sharing our FLL experience and knowledge 
 with our new Aboriginal friends. We looked forward to learning more about their culture and tradition in the coming week.

	<h2>Presenting Our Research Project at a School Assembly</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On Friday, December 9th, 2016, Ctrl-Z presented their research and innovative solution 
	in front of 200 attendees from the Bayview Glen Middle School. The students were entertained 
	by the skit and were intrigued by the prevalence of the problem we were studying. 
	We were asked interesting questions that showed the strengths of our invention, as well as what we still 
	had to improve upon. It was really a great learning experience for both the audience and us.

	<h2>Congratulations to our Friends at the First Nations School of Toronto!!!</h2>
	<br>
	<p>On Dec 17, 2016, our friends from Team Tribe Called Tech (FLL #21312) won Champions Award, 
	First Place at the 28-team TDSB FLL Regional Qualifying Tournament hosted by Woburn C.I.  
	We are thrilled at how Tribe Called Tech mastered all three FLL elements: research, 
	robot and core values, against a very strong field of competing teams.  We are honored that 
	Tribe Called Tech and Ctrl-Z have partnered this Animal Allies season to share best practices along with culture with one another.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ctrl-Z wishes Team Tribe Called Tech the best of luck as they advance to compete at the
