	<h2>Meeting with Team Mustangs 28624</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On Sunday, October 9, 2016, Ctrl-Z assisted Team Mustangs 28624, a rookie team. We invited 
	Mustangs to our school and we shared insight on how they could improve their robot and learn 
	new concepts in order to achieve more and take more away from their experience in FLL. 
	It was great to meet and help a fellow team who is as interested in FLL as we are. 
	Best of luck to the team.

Showcasing cutting-edge technology and innovation in the most exciting categories: virtual reality, drones, wearables, hearables, health & fitness, 
gaming, audio, home theatre, robotics, 3D printing, personal transportation, smart devices and electric vehicles – the show attracted

<h2>Meeting with Team <i>Tribe Called Tech</i> At Bayview Glen School</h2>
<br>
<p>On Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Ctrl-Z welcomed Team <i>Tribe Called Tech</i> of the First Nations School of Toronto
 to our school for an afternoon of learning and collaboration. Members of Ctrl-Z divided into two groups to teach the 
 First Nations students robot design and programming. We covered the characteristics of a robust base robot and modular attachments.
 For programming we taught calibration, line following, and basic robot navigation. We enjoyed sharing our FLL experience and knowledge 
 with our new Aboriginal friends. We looked forward to learning more about their culture and tradition in the coming week.
