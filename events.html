	<h2>FLL Ontario Animal Allies Season Kick-off and Training Event</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On Saturday, September 24, 2016, Ctrl-Z presented to many new and returning teams (over 120 attendees) at
	the FLL Animal Allies Season Kick-off and Training Event hosted at Bayview Glen School. There, the team refreshed and
	helped improve many enthusiasts' building, programming, and research skills. It shared various concepts, from
	introductory to advanced, to help other teams make the best of this year’s season.

	<h2>Meeting with Team Mustangs 28624</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	On Sunday, October 9, 2016, Ctrl-Z assisted Team Mustangs 28624, a rookie team. We invited 
	Mustangs to our school and we shared insight on how they could improve their robot and learn 
	new concepts in order to achieve more and take more away from their experience in FLL. 
	It was great to meet and help a fellow team who is as interested in FLL as we are. 
	Best of luck to the team.

<h2>Presenting at the TAVES Consumer Electronic Show</h2>
<br>
<p>On October 29, 2016, Ctrl-Z presented its 2015/2016 innovative solution at the TAVES Consumer Electronics Show
at the Sheraton Parkway Toronto North & Best Western Hotels in Richmond Hill, Ontario.  
The team's objectives were to inspire youth to develop innovative solutions, to follow their dreams in starting up new business ventures, 
and to raise awareness for FIRST Robotics.  TAVES is said to be the place to connect with tech-savvy consumers with a taste for innovative products. 
Showcasing cutting-edge technology and innovation in the most exciting categories: virtual reality, drones, wearables, hearables, health & fitness, 
gaming, audio, home theatre, robotics, 3D printing, personal transportation, smart devices and electric vehicles – the show attracted 
approximately 6,500 attendees from October 28 to October 30, 2016.

<h2>Meeting with Team <i>Tribe Called Tech</i> At Bayview Glen School</h2>
<br>
<p>On Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Ctrl-Z welcomed Team <i>Tribe Called Tech</i> of the First Nations School of Toronto
 to our school for an afternoon of learning and collaboration. Members of Ctrl-Z divided into two groups to teach the 
 First Nations students robot design and programming. We covered the characteristics of a robust base robot and modular attachments.
 For programming we taught calibration, line following, and basic robot navigation. We enjoyed sharing our FLL experience and knowledge 
 with our new Aboriginal friends. We looked forward to learning more about their culture and tradition in the coming week.

	<p>
	On Friday, December 9th, 2016, Ctrl-Z presented their research and innovative solution 
	in front of 200 attendees from the Bayview Glen Middle School. The students were entertained 
	by the skit and were intrigued by the prevalence of the problem we were studying. 
	We were asked interesting questions that showed the strengths of our invention, as well as what we still 
	had to improve upon. It was really a great learning experience for both the audience and us.

	From the pitch, there was great interest from the investors, many of whom offered to assist the team with technology, 
	contacts, further refinement of the product, incorporation of Pinder as a business and other areas.  
	Ctrl-Z is so fortunate to have had the opportunity to present its invention to such a knowledgeable 
	audience whose members are both generous with their time and incredibly motivated to encourage 
	innovation amongst young people.  Ctrl-Z expresses its gratitude to YAI for its support this Animal Allies season.
