<h4>Lost Dog Behavior missingpetpartnership.org</h4>

<p>	Reasons dogs leave:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many dogs, even dogs that are not normally fearful at home, become terrified when lost.</li>
<li>Opportunistic journey - when they get the opportunity to explore.</li>
<li>Wanderlust - certain dogs will actively attempt to escape by climbing or digging because they want to breed</li>
<li>Blind panic - a situation where the dog just runs away, unaware of where they are going</li>
</ul>
<p>Why dogs travel far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperment, circumstances (fireworks, thunder), weather (dog who escapes goes further in nice weather than in extreme conditions),
terrain and population density (run farther in country than in the urban city), appearance of the dog (small = friendly, big = aggressive)</li>
<li>Gregarious dog - friendly dogs who come to the first person who calls</li>
<li>Aloof dogs - will initially avoid human contact.These dogs run a great distance</li>
<li>Fearful dogs - higher risk to get hit by cars.Travel the furthest </li>
</ul>

<h4>Pet Microchips:  High-Tech Protection Helps Find Lost Pets</h4>
<h4>https://public.homeagain.com/pdf/microchipping-whitepaper.pdf</h4>
<ul>
<li>10 million dogs lost or stolen in the U.S. every year</li>
<li>One in three pets are lost in their lifetime</li>
<li>Non-microchipped return rate:  Dogs - 22%, Cats - 2%</li>
<li>Microchipped return rate:  Dogs - 52%, Cats - 38%</li>
<li>Only 58% of microchipped animals had been registered</li>
<li>Microchips are about the size of a grain of rice</li>
<li>Microchip implantation is painless</li>
<li>Lasts life of pet</li>
<li>Costs around $45 for implantation and microchip</li>
<li>Only 5% of cats and dogs are microchipped</li>
