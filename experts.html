				Claudia Vecchio was born and raised in Milan, Italy. After completing her postgraduate degree in Political Science, 
				majoring in International Law, at the University of Milan, she moved to Brussels where she undertook further postgraduate 
				courses on Law of the European Union. After a short period of teaching at York University, she went into Real Estate.
				<br>
				Since her childhood, Claudia has shown a great love for animals and a particular attraction to cats. 
				She has rescued stray and abandoned cats on her own for 25 years. In 2002, she realized that she could no longer 
				carry out these massive rescue efforts by herself. She decided, with Corrine Thaw, to found 
				ORA - Organization for the Rescue of Animals - a rescue organization that obtained charitable status in November 2002.
				<br>
				Claudia's dream is to create wildlife sanctuaries throughout Southern Ontario - oasis where wildlife, 
				endangered by urban sprawl, may find quiet and peaceful areas in which to live undisturbed.
